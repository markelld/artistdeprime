## Overview

_**Project Title**  

Artiste Déprimé
  
The project inspiration came from my love for art and photography. So I decided to create a site for artist to post there work,events or anything they wish. My goal is to create a community online strictly for artist.

## MVP

> The app will include authentication and crud functionality for users to post,edit and delete there posts(only posts that belong to them). Users will also be able to comment on other users posts.  

<br>

### Goals

- secure authentication
- fully functional crud
- fully responsive design
- lay foundation for app that can scale upwards in the future

#### Component Tree

> Use this section to display the structure of how your React components are being rendered. This should show the parent to child relation between you components. In other words, show which components are rendering the other components. 

#### Component Hierarchy

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app. This should be a reflection of how you expect your directory/file tree to look like. 

``` structure

src
|__ assets/
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images
      |__ mockups
|__ components/
      |__ Header.jsx
|__ services/

```

> _Why is this necessary? Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evaluate possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe._
